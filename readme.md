# Fieldfare Zephyr module

This Zephyr module enables running the [Fieldfare](https://github.com/moduhub/fieldfare) backend framework on any Zephyr supported microcontroller by using the JerryScript engine and Zephyr's filesystem and crypto drivers. Currently, the only microcontroller where the system is being tested is the nRF52840.
